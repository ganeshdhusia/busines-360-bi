1. Project Title / Headline
Business Insight 360 – End-to-End Power BI Analytics Dashboard

2. Short Description / Purpose
A complete 360° analytics dashboard built to track business performance and support decisions with clear, actionable insights.

3. Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
• 📂 Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.
• 📝 Data Modeling – Relationships established among tables (date, fact sales, customer, product tables) to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.
• 📁 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

4. Data Source
The dataset used in this project was provided by my instructor as part of a guided learning project. It includes sample business data for practice and educational purposes.

5. Features / Highlights
✅ Key Questions Addressed by the Dashboard

How are Net Sales, Gross Margin, and Net Profit trending over the last four years?

Which customers and products contribute the most and least to sales performance?

Which marketing categories/segments are performing well, and which need improvement?

How accurate is the supply chain forecast, and what is the financial impact of forecast errors?

Which regions, customers, and segments are driving overall business growth?

Why is net profit declining despite strong revenue and market share growth?

🎯 Goal of the Dashboard

To provide a unified 360° view of AtliQ’s financial, sales, marketing, and supply chain performance and help business leaders identify improvement opportunities, analyze trends, and make data-driven strategic decisions.

⭐ Key Highlights & Insights (Summarized from Your Findings)

📌 Finance View
Net Sales increased significantly from 111.37M to 3736.71M, showing strong revenue growth.
However, Net Profit dropped sharply from 2.46M to –522.42M, primarily due to rising operational costs, especially ads & marketing expenses.
P&L matrix analysis confirmed that high operating expenses are the main reason for declining profitability despite growing sales.

📌 Sales View
Identified top-performing and bottom-performing customers and products.
Scatter plot revealed customers performing below 10% of the target benchmark, helping focus on underperforming accounts.
Clear segmentation of high-value customers vs low-value customers.

Unit economics show that to earn a 38.08% Gross Margin, the business spends 61.92% on COGS.
Insights highlight segments needing strategic marketing adjustments.
